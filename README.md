# Workout-Tracker
Workout Tracker

For this assignment, We were given front-end starter code and tasked with adding a database and backend code to connect the app function properly. 

### Prerequisites

In order to use the workout tracker, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look. 

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see this:

If you click to create a new workout you will be presented with a series of menus prompting you to enter the workout information:

Once you've finished inputting all the information about your exercise, you now have the option of stopping there, or you can add more exercises. Click "Add exercise" to add the current exercise, and restart the process so that you can add another exercise. Or just hit "complete" and your workout will be saved. 

After you've saved a workout to the database the homepage will now look slightly different:

You now have the option of modifying your previous workout by hitting the "continue workout" button.

You can also visit a stats page by clicking on the "dashboard" button on the top left
